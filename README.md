Description: 
    V-Pal is a voting software that processes ballots from Instant Runoff Voting, Open Party List Voting, and Popularity Voting. Ballots are processed in the form of CSV files (ballot files are detailed in the SDD document). V-Pal processes the ballots and creates a Media/Summary file for the public and an Audit file for the election officials. Furthermore, a summary of the results will be printed on the screen of who the winner is and their stats (party and number of votes received).

Tools/Techniques:
